It can affect any part of the body, but it is most common on the arms, legs, and back. Eczema is not contagious, but it can be passed from one person to another. It is often passed in families. It can also be triggered by certain medications, foods, and other factors. The most common type of eczema is atopic dermatitis, which is related to dry skin. People with atopic dermatitis may experience dry skin even when the skin is not dry. Dry skin can be caused by low humidity, excessive bathing, harsh soaps, and certain medications. Try to eliminate aggravating factors. Reduce the frequency of bathing. Use a mild soap and lukewarm water. Apply a good moisturizer frequently, especially after bathing. Use a topical steroid cream twice daily for 2-4 weeks and oral antihistamines may be used if needed."

Shave rash is not usually a serious condition, but it can sometimes be a sign of a more serious underlying condition. If you have a history of shaving or if you have many ingrown hairs, you may be more prone to develop a shave rash. Shave rash can be triggered by shaving too frequently, using dull blades, or shaving against the grain. Shave rash can also be triggered by other factors such as sun exposure, heat, and friction from clothing or other materials. Shave rash can be treated with warm compresses, topical antibiotics, and/or oral antibiotics. Shave rash can recur after shaving, so it is important to take steps to prevent it from happening again. These steps include: Shave once and then let your hair grow out for a few weeks, using a new razor each time, shaving against the grain, using a gentle shaving technique, and avoiding irritants such as hairspray, perfume, and deodorant."

Oral medications include antibiotics, antifungals, and isotretinoin. Antibiotics are used to treat acneiform lesions that are caused by bacteria. Antibiotics are also used to treat acneiform lesions that are caused by yeast. Antifungals are used to treat acneiform lesions that are caused by fungi.

You can get folliculitis if you have a weakened immune system, such as due to HIV infection, or if you have a chronic skin condition that makes you more susceptible to infection.

To treat dry skin, use a mild soap and lukewarm water to wash your hands and face. Apply a moisturizer frequently, especially after bathing, and when itchy. Use topical medications such as topical hydrocortisone cream, topical retinoids, or topical antibiotics.

This is a quick and painless procedure. It is usually done in a doctor's office. Laser treatment is also an option. This is a more expensive option, but it is usually more effective.

When the sweat glands are activated, they can become blocked, which can cause itching and sometimes infection. This condition is not contagious. It usually improves or resolves on its own within a few days. You can help prevent heat rash by wearing loose cotton clothing, using a mild soap, and avoiding excessive sweating.

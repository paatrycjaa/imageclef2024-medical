People often refer to them as \"tiny veins\" because of their size. They can occur anywhere on the body or face. For most people, telangiectasias neither cause any damage to overall health nor require treatment. However, they can sometimes indicate a more severe medical condition and may warrant closer inspection. There is no cure for telangiectasia, but it is treatable. Laser therapy is minimally invasive and is typically the most straightforward treatment for telangiectasia and broken capillaries. Laser ablation can seal the widened blood vessels. This procedure does not cause much pain, and the recovery time is short. Sclerotherapy is also an effective option where a solution is injected into the veins causing inflammation and hence shrinkage of the veins."

If you cut or damage your skin in some way, it's easier for the virus to take hold. That's why people with chronic skin conditions, such as eczema, or who bite their nails or pick at hangnails are prone to getting warts. Warts are highly contagious and are mainly passed by direct skin contact, such as when you pick at your warts and then touch another area of your body. You can also spread them with things like towels or razors that have touched a wart on your body or on someone else's. Most warts are harmless, and you don't need to do anything unless, of course, they're painful or embarrassing. Over-the-counter gels, liquids, and pads with salicylic acid work by peeling away the dead skin cells of the wart to gradually dissolve it. For better results, soak the wart in warm water, then gently sand it with a disposable emery board before you apply the product. Be sure to use a new emery board each time. Be patient, it can take several months. If you have diabetes or a weakened immune system, you should have a doctor take a look before you treat a wart yourself. Cryotherapy, immunotherapy, laser treatment and topical cantharidin are good therapeutic options."

There are several things that can cause increased melanin production in the skin, including:\n\nFatigue\nProlonged sun exposure (even with sunscreen applied)\nSmoking\nAlcohol consumption\nVitamins and mineral deficiencies, such as vitamin B12 and vitamin K\nHormone fluctuations\nMedications like painkillers and birth control pills\nAll of these things can cause fatigue, and it's important to get enough sleep and to manage your time effectively to avoid fatigue. Rest is important for your body to recover, so try to get enough sleep each night. You can also try to minimise your time in the sun, wear sunscreen every day, avoid alcohol and painkillers when you have fatigue, and ensure you have adequate vitamin B12 and vitamin K levels. If you have persistent fatigue or you're worried about an underlying cause, you should speak with your doctor."

                "content_en": "It is a case of eczema due to dry skin (xerosis), contact, allergy, or atopic eczema. Dryness is commonly seen in people with atopic dermatitis. People exposed to a dry environment may experience dry skin, for example low humidity in desert climates or cool windy conditions, excessive air conditioning, direct heat from a fire or fan heater, excessive bathing, contact with soap, laundry detergents and solvents, inappropriate topical agents such as alcohol, frictional irritation from rough clothing or abrasives. Try to eliminate aggravating factors. Reduce the frequency of bathing, use a humidifier in winter and air conditioner in summer, compare having a short shower with a prolonged soak in a hot bath, ensure good hydration by drinking plenty of water, use lukewarm water not hot water, replace standard soap with a substitute such as a synthetic detergent cleanser, water-miscible emollient, bath oil, anti-pruritic tar oil, colloidal oatmeal etc., and apply an emollient liberally and often, particularly shortly after bathing, and when itchy. The drier the skin, the thicker this should be, especially on the hands. Apply emollients frequently and avoid irritants. Use topical steroid cream twice daily for 2-4 weeks and oral antihistamines if needed. If persistent, it is recommended to consult your dermatologist. It is also worth mentioning the duration of the lesion may rise Becker's nevus, a non-cancerous large brown birthmark occurring mostly in males, as a possible diagnosis."

Examples of surfaces that could cause friction blisters include rough clothing, bed linens, or towels. They can also be caused by repetitive rubbing of the same area, such as when a person with hairy arms brushes his or her arms against a rough surface. Blisters usually heal on their own in a few weeks, but there are ways you can speed up the healing process. Apply a moisturizing cream containing aloe vera, petroleum jelly or shea butter. Wear loose cotton clothing. Avoid friction by wearing gloves when doing household chores."

You can get folliculitis from folliculitis of the hair follicles, which is often caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. They can also be caused by hair removal, such as when you get a bikini line or back acne, or weight gain. The most common cause of folliculitis is a bacterial infection of the hair follicle, usually Staphylococcus aureus. This can happen after shaving, plucking, or other hair removal procedures. You can get folliculitis from these actions too. Other causes of folliculitis include: wearing tight clothing or shoes, using harsh chemicals on your skin, such as detergents and solvents, swimming in pools with contaminated water, and certain medications. To treat folliculitis, you need to identify the cause. If it is caused by bacteria, you need to clean the area and take antibiotics to kill the bacteria. If it is caused by a virus or a fungus, you need to get rid of the infected hair and use a topical antifungal to help the skin heal. You can also use a topical antibiotic to help the skin heal. To prevent future infections, you should clean the area and use a topical antibiotic or antifungal after shaving, plucking, or other hair removal procedures. You can also use a topical antibiotic to help the skin heal. To prevent future infections, you should keep the area clean and dry. Use a topical antibiotic to help the skin heal."

It occurs when certain areas of the skin produce too much melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. There are many different causes of hyperpigmentation, including sun exposure, hormonal influences, medications, and medical conditions. The most common cause of hyperpigmentation is sun exposure. People with fair skin are more prone to hyperpigmentation and age spots. They should use high SPF sunscreen to protect their skin from the sun's harmful rays. They can also use topical medications to help lighten dark spots, such as hydroquinone and azelaic acid. Creams containing steroids and vitamin C are also effective for lightening dark spots."

Trichostasis spinulosa is usually diagnosed clinically and investigation is not necessary for the majority of cases. Treatment of trichostasis spinulosa usually results in improvement in symptoms. Mild cases may be cured by gently detangling the hair or using a topical antifollure/antibacterial product. More severe cases may require surgical excision of the affected hair follicles."

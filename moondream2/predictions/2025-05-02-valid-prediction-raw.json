Keloids are formed when the body produces excess collagen during the healing process after an injury or surgical procedure. The collagen fibers extend beyond the boundaries of the original wound, resulting in a raised, thickened scar.\n\nKeloids can be treated with various methods, including corticosteroid injections, silicone gel sheets, and laser therapy. In some cases, surgical removal of the excess collagen may also be considered. However, it is essential to consult with a dermatologist or a healthcare professional to determine the most suitable treatment plan based on the individual's specific case and medical history."

Acne vulgaris is a chronic skin condition that causes inflammation and the formation of pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads. It is often treated with medications such as isotretinoin (Accutane), which is a powerful prescription medication used to treat severe cases of acne.\n\nThe side effect of peeling feet seen in the image is due to the medication's impact on the skin's oil glands, which can lead to dryness and peeling. This is a temporary condition that usually improves over time as the body adjusts to the medication. To minimize the peeling and discomfort, it is essential to maintain a proper skincare routine, including gentle cleansers, moisturizers, and avoiding harsh exfoliants. Additionally, patients should follow their healthcare provider's advice and closely monitor their skin's response to the medication to ensure that the treatment is effective and any adverse effects are addressed promptly."

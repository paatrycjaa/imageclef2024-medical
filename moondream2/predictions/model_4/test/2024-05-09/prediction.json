However, if they are painful or embarrassing, they may be surgically removed. Seborrheic cysts can also be associated with seborrheic dermatitis, a skin condition that causes flaky and itchy skin. The flaky skin is due to sebaceous material getting trapped on the skin's surface. Seborrheic dermatitis is often treated with topical selenium sulfide shampoo, selenium sulfide pads, and topical selenium sulfide creams."

This is a simple plastic device that covers the dog's mouth, preventing them from biting. Masks are also available for dogs.\n- If your dog does bite, seek veterinary advice on how to treat the wound and consider having the wound inspected by a dermatologist to remove any chance of infection."

You can get infected ingrown toenail if you trim the nail too short or curve the nail back into the skin in a way that it presses against the skin of your toe. This can happen if you clip your nails too short or you curve your nail back too far. You are at higher risk of ingrown toenails if you wear tight-fitting shoes or if you have diabetes. To prevent ingrown toenails, you can trim your nails straight across (so they are not too long or too short) and then let your nails grow out without cutting them. When you do cut your nails, make sure you cut them straight across and then clean the area around the nail bed to prevent infection. After you cut your nails, soak them in warm, shallow water. This will soften the skin around the nail and help prevent ingrown nails. You can also apply a topical antibiotic to the area and then cover the nail with a bandage. If you have diabetes, you should see your doctor about how to treat your ingrown nails because if left untreated, an ingrown nail can lead to infection of the nail bed and, in severe cases, infection of the surrounding tissues. In some cases, the nail may need to be removed."

If you cut or damage your skin in some way, it's easier for the virus to take hold. That's why people with chronic skin conditions, such as eczema, or who bite their nails or pick at hangnails are prone to getting warts. Warts are highly contagious and are mainly passed by direct skin contact, such as when you pick at your warts and then touch another area of your body. You can also spread them with things like towels or razors that have touched a wart on your body or on someone else's. Most warts are harmless, and you don't need to do anything unless, of course, they're painful or embarrassing. Over-the-counter gels, liquids, and pads with salicylic acid work by peeling away the dead skin cells of the wart to gradually dissolve it. For better results, soak the wart in warm water, then gently sand it with a disposable emery board before you apply the product. Be sure to use a new emery board each time. Be patient, it can take several months. If you have diabetes or a weakened immune system, you should have a doctor take a look before you treat a wart yourself. Cryotherapy, immunotherapy, laser treatment and topical cantharidin are good therapeutic options."

Although it is not considered infectious in the conventional sense, pityriasis versicolor sometimes affects more than one member of a family. Mild pityriasis versicolor is treated with topical antifungal agents. Selenium sulfide shampoo, Topical azole cream/shampoo (econazole, ketoconazole), Terbinafine gel. The medicine should be applied widely to the skin from the jawline down and left on the skin for 5-15 minutes before rinsing off in the shower. This should be done daily for one week then weekly for one month. Oral antifungal agents, itraconazole and fluconazole, are used to treat pityriasis versicolor when extensive or if topical agents have failed. Vigorous exercise an hour after taking the medication may help sweat it onto the skin surface, where it can effectively eradicate the yeast. Bathing should be avoided for a few hours. A few days' treatment will clear many cases of pityriasis versicolor, but it may persist permanently in some people."

Telangiectasia is a common feature of aging and is often described as the \"elephant's feet\" of the skin. It is also called the \"broken capillaries\" of the skin. Telangiectasia is not a skin cancer; however, it may be a sign of an underlying medical condition that affects blood flow to the skin. For example, hypertension, diabetes, and pregnancy may cause increased blood flow to the skin. Dermatologists usually do not treat telangiectasia unless they are noticeable. However, some people find that laser therapy is useful for treating telangiectasia and improving the appearance of the skin. Laser therapy can be done in the dermatology office or in a medical spa. The dermatologist can recommend a particular type of laser based on the individual's skin type and the appearance of the telangiectasia. Some lasers are better than others for treating telangiectasia. The most effective laser for treating telangiectasia is the pulsed light laser. This laser delivers a short burst of light that is specifically designed to target blood vessels. The light damages the blood vessels without harming the surrounding skin. This makes the blood vessels shrink and fade away. The procedure is painless and can be done in the dermatology office. Many people find that laser therapy is better than topical creams and serums for treating telangiectasia."

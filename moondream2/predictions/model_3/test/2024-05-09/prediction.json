This can damage the blood vessels in their feet. Feet that are poorly ventilated, such as those covered with shoes, are also a good environment for fungi to grow. You can get a fungal infection if you wear enclosed footwear, walk barefoot in a public area where many people walk around, such as a locker room or sauna. You can also get a fungal infection if your feet have become very sweaty while you were in a confined space with poor ventilation. Let your feet air out, wash your feet daily, change your socks regularly, alternate pairs of shoes, and protect your feet in public places.

Look for a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and apply it every day.\n- Wear protective clothing: long sleeves, hats, and sunglasses can all help protect your skin from the sun.\n- Use topical steroids: apply a topical steroid cream to the area once daily for a week then twice daily for a week, then once per day for a month, and then once per week for a month. This will help reduce the appearance of the hyperpigmentation.\n- Use topical azelaic acid: this is a type of vitamin C that helps reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation. You can use a cream, lotion, or spray containing azelaic acid. Apply it once daily for a month. If you have sensitive skin, you can try using an over-the-counter (OTC) hydrocortisone cream.

They are caused by a virus of the family human papillomavirus (HPV). If you cut or damage your skin in some way, it's easier for the virus to take hold. That's why people with chronic skin conditions, such as eczema, or who bite their nails or pick at hangnails are prone to getting warts. Warts are highly contagious and are mainly passed by direct skin contact, such as when you pick at your warts and then touch another area of your body. You can also spread them with things like towels or razors that have touched a wart on your body or on someone else's. Most warts are harmless, and you don't need to do anything unless, of course, they're painful or embarrassing. Over-the-counter gels, liquids, and pads with salicylic acid work by peeling away the dead skin cells of the wart to gradually dissolve it. For better results, soak the wart in warm water, then gently sand it with a disposable emery board before you apply the product. Be sure to use a new emery board each time. Be patient, it can take several months. If you have diabetes or a weakened immune system, you should have a doctor take a look before you treat a wart yourself. Cryotherapy, immunotherapy, laser treatment and topical cantharidin are good therapeutic options."

If you cut or damage your skin in some way, it's easier for the virus to take hold. That's why people with chronic skin conditions, such as eczema, or who bite their nails or pick at hangnails are prone to getting warts. Warts are highly contagious and are mainly passed by direct skin contact, such as when you pick at your warts and then touch another area of your body. You can also spread them with things like towels or razors that have touched a wart on your body or on someone else's. Most warts are harmless, and you don't need to do anything unless, of course, they're painful or embarrassing. Over-the-counter gels, liquids, and pads with salicylic acid work by peeling away the dead skin cells of the wart to gradually dissolve it. For better results, soak the wart in warm water, then gently sand it with a disposable emery board before you apply the product. Be sure to use a new emery board each time. Be patient, it can take several months. If you have diabetes or a weakened immune system, you should have a doctor take a look before you treat a wart yourself. Cryotherapy, immunotherapy, laser treatment and topical cantharidin are good therapeutic options."

This will remove the dead skin cells that ringworm uses as food. There are many over-the-counter antifungal creams and liquids that you can apply to the skin to treat ringworm. It may take several months, but you should continue to apply the cream or take the medicine regularly until the ringworm is gone and you can see that it has been completely eradicated."

Acne medications are broadly divided into two groups based on how they affect the oil glands:\n\nAcyclic Acne Creams and Gels: These are used to treat acne without inflammation. They include benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and antibiotics like clindamycin or erythromycin.\n\nTreated Acne: This includes the pimples that have been treated and are now healing. You may need to continue using an acne medication for a few months to years to keep the acne under control.\n\nThe acne medicine you need depends on how severe your acne is. Mild acne that only has a few pimples that are healing can be treated with a topical acne cream or gel. More severe acne may require an oral antibiotic, a steroid cream or gel, or a combination of both."

You are also at risk of folliculitis if you shave your head, cut your hair very short, or use a lot of styling products. To treat folliculitis, you should stop doing these things and avoid using any products that might irritate your skin, such as pomade. Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and apply a good moisturizer to your scalp. You can take antibiotics to treat an infection associated with the folliculitis, but this is not common."

For example, telangiectasia may be a sign of deep vein thrombosis, in which case you may need a blood thinner to prevent a blood clot from becoming blocked in a deep vein. Telangiectasia may also be a sign of rosacea, a chronic inflammatory skin condition that usually begins between the age of 30\u00e2\u20ac\u201c60 years. Rosacea is more common in women than in men. It is not contagious. Symptoms of rosacea can flare up if you are stressed, anxious, or hot. Use gentle or sensitive skin moisturizers throughout the day when you have a mild to moderate case of rosacea. Apply moisturizer when your skin is damp after a bath or shower. This will help your skin retain moisture throughout the day. Apply topical medications to your skin like topical azelaic acid, topical retinoids, or topical steroids. Take oral medications like antihistamines, beta-blockers, or vasodilators to reduce the redness and swelling associated with rosacea. Laser therapy is also an option.

It commonly occurs in people whose feet have become very sweaty while confined within tight-fitting shoes. The condition is contagious and can be spread via contaminated floors, towels, or clothing. You are at higher risk of athlete's foot if you frequently wear enclosed footwear, sweat heavily, share mats, rugs, bed linens, clothes, or shoes with someone who has a fungal infection, walk barefoot in public areas where the infection can spread, such as locker rooms, saunas, swimming pools, communal baths and showers. Let your feet air out, wash your feet daily, change your socks regularly, alternate pairs of shoes, and protect your feet in public places. Apply topical antifungal cream (terbinafine or clotrimazole) twice daily for two to four weeks. If resistant to tretmant, consult a dermatologist for prescribing oral antifungal."

It is mostly seen in people of Asian, Black, and Latin descent. It can occur in individuals with hyperpigmentation or melanodermatosis, or it can be a benign condition associated with increased melanin production. It can also be a sign of a skin cancer depending on the context. It is important to rule out any skin cancer before considering treatment for melanonychia. Treatment options include laser therapy, chemical peeling, and topical steroids."

                "content_en": "It is a case of Pityriasis versicolor, a common yeast infection of the skin, in which flaky discolored patches appear on the chest and back. Pityriasis versicolor is more common in hot, humid climates than in cool, dry climates. It often affects people who perspire heavily. It may clear in the winter months and recur each summer. Although it is not considered infectious in the conventional sense, pityriasis versicolor sometimes affects more than one member of a family. Mild pityriasis versicolor is treated with topical antifungal agents. Selenium sulfide shampoo, Topical azole cream/shampoo (econazole, ketoconazole), Terbinafine gel. The medicine should be applied widely to the skin from the jawline down and left on the skin for 5-15 minutes before rinsing off in the shower. This should be done daily for one week then weekly for one month. Oral antifungal agents, itraconazole and fluconazole, are used to treat pityriasis versicolor when extensive or if topical agents have failed. Vigorous exercise an hour after taking the medication may help sweat it onto the skin surface, where it can effectively eradicate the yeast. Bathing should be avoided for a few hours. A few days' treatment will clear many cases of pityriasis long term, or at least for several months. Reapplication of a topical treatment such as selenium sulfide shampoo every month once the rash has cleared will usually prevent recurrence."

                "content_en": "It is a case of eczema due to dry skin (xerosis). Dryness is commonly seen in people with atopic dermatitis. People exposed to a dry environment may experience dry skin, for example, low humidity in desert climates or cool windy conditions, excessive air conditioning, direct heat from a fire or fan heater, excessive bathing, contact with soap, laundry detergents and solvents, inappropriate topical agents such as alcohol, frictional irritation from rough clothing or abrasives. Try to eliminate aggravating factors. Reduce the frequency of bathing, use a humidifier in winter and air conditioner in summer, compare having a short shower with a prolonged soak in a hot bath, ensure good hydration by drinking plenty of water, use lukewarm water not hot water, replace standard soap with a substitute such as a synthetic detergent cleanser, water-miscible emollient, bath oil, anti-pruritic tar oil, colloidal oatmeal etc., and apply an emollient liberally and often, particularly shortly after bathing, and when itchy. The drier the skin, the thicker this should be, especially on the hands. Apply emollients frequently and avoid irritants. Use topical steroid cream twice daily for 2-4 weeks and oral antihistamines if needed."

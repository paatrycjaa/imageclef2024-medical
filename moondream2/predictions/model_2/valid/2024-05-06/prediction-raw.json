Worsening occurs when seasonal changes cause low humidity and dry skin you can treat it with moisturizers and prescription creams to help improve how the skin looks. Creams to remove dead skin cells like creams containing alpha hydroxy acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, or urea help loosen and remove dead skin cells. They also moisturize and soften dry skin. For best results, apply your moisturizer after every shower or bath, within 5 minutes of getting out of the bath or shower, while your skin is still damp. At least 2 or 3 times a day, gently massaging it into the skin. You can also use topical retinoid creams to help unclog follicles and promote cell turnover. Some patients may need to apply a corticosteroid to the areas with keratosis pilaris. This medicine helps soften the bumps and reduce redness. Lasers may work when moisturizers and medicine fail. Using medicated cream regularly may improve how the skin looks. But if you stop, the condition returns. And even with treatment, keratosis pilaris might last for years."

If you cut or damage your skin in some way, it's easier for the virus to take hold. That's why people with chronic skin conditions, such as eczema, or who bite their nails or pick at hangnails are prone to getting warts. Warts are highly contagious and are mainly passed by direct skin contact, such as when you pick at your warts and then touch another area of your body. You can also spread them with things like towels or razors that have touched a wart on your body or on someone else's. Most warts are harmless, and you don't need to do anything unless, of course, they're painful or embarrassing. Over-the-counter gels, liquids, and pads with salicylic acid work by peeling away the dead skin cells of the wart to gradually dissolve it. For better results, soak the wart in warm water, then gently sand it with a disposable emery board before you apply the product. Be sure to use a new emery board each time. Be patient, it can take several months. If you have diabetes or a weakened immune system, you should have a doctor take a look before you treat a wart yourself. Cryotherapy, immunotherapy, laser treatment and topical cantharidin are good therapeutic options."

While many things can damage your hair follicles, the following are also common causes of folliculitis hot tub (improperly maintained), shaving, plucking, or waxing, tight clothing or equipment, medication applied to the skin, such as coal tar, medication you take, or weight gain. Apply a warm compress at least 3 to 4 times a day. Leave the compress on your skin for 15 to 20 minutes each time.

In most cases, if the cause is an organism or a drug, then the exposure should be discontinued. Most patients recover within a few weeks. For any residual lesions, treatments that have been used to treat acneiform eruptions include laser ablation, excision, topical or oral antibiotics, drug withdrawal, or the use of topical or oral retinoids. If the cause is a fungal infection like Pityrosporum folliculitis, then the use of topical antifungal agents can be helpful such as ciclopirox, econazole, and ketoconazole."

An angioma is due to proliferating endothelial cells; these are the cells that line the inside of a blood vessel. It is usually diagnosed clinically and investigation is not necessary for the majority of lesions. Cherry angiomas are harmless, so do not have to be treated. If desired for cosmetic reasons, Cryotherapy, Electrosurgery, or Vascular laser can be used."

People exposed to a dry environment may experience dry skin, for example low humidity in desert climates or cool windy conditions, excessive air conditioning, direct heat from a fire or fan heater, excessive bathing, contact with soap, laundry detergents and solvents, inappropriate topical agents such as alcohol, frictional irritation from rough clothing or abrasives. Try to eliminate aggravating factors. Reduce the frequency of bathing, use a humidifier in winter and air conditioner in summer, compare having a short shower with a prolonged soak in a hot bath, ensure good hydration by drinking plenty of water, use lukewarm water not hot water, replace standard soap with a substitute such as a synthetic detergent cleanser, water-miscible emollient, bath oil, anti-pruritic tar oil, colloidal oatmeal etc., and apply an emollient liberally and often, particularly shortly after bathing, and when itchy. The drier the skin, the thicker this should be, especially on the hands. Apply emollients frequently and avoid irritants. Use topical steroid cream twice daily for 2-4 weeks and oral antihistamines if needed."

You should look at any products you're using around your nail including soap, hand sanitizer, and nail polish. It will likely get better if you stop using the product and let the nail grow out. You could also try a topical steroid to help it heal faster."
